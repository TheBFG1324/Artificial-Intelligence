# Artificial Intelligence Classwork

## Overview

In my Artificial Intelligence class, I worked on a series of projects focused on implementing classic AI techniques, providing hands-on experience with foundational concepts in the field.

## Key Projects and Techniques

### Search Algorithms:
- **8-Queens Solver**: Implemented using **Backtracking** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.
- **A* Algorithm**: Applied to solve pathfinding and optimization problems.

### Reinforcement Learning:
- Developed an agent to learn policies through **Policy Training**.
- Simulated **Monte Carlo Methods** for policy evaluation and improvement.

### Optimization Techniques:
- **Simulated Annealing**: Explored its application for optimization in complex problems.
- **Weighted Monte Carlo Simulations**: Used to refine decision-making processes.

### Decision Models:
- Built and analyzed **Decision Trees** for classification and problem-solving tasks.

### Markov Models:
- Simulated **Markov Chains** for probabilistic modeling and decision-making.
